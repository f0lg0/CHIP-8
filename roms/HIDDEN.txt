HIDDEN is a "memory" game. It is very simple to play.

The rules are as follow: your goal is to find all the identical cards
in a minimum time.

You are playing in a 4*4 card grid. You can see only two cards at the
same time. Once this time passed, these two cards will remain shown
if they are identical, otherwise they will be hidden again.

When the game is finished, two scores are shown:
        SC is your score, corresponding to the number of tries
        HI is the best score (smallest number of tries made to finish)

The keys are:

        [2] : More DOWN
        [4] : Move LEFT
        [5] : Show card
        [6] : Move RIGHT
        [8] : Move UP

Enjoy !!!
